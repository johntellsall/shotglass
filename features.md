## Tags mode

In "tags mode", a source tree is colored per tag, or directory.  Since
Flask has only one directory, it's not that interesting. Image on the
left is rendered with one color per directory, on the right with one
color per file.

Django has lots of directories, so tags mode makes the different areas
show more clearly. Compare per-directory
