# GOALS

## FIRST ENABLE: BUILD "FILE" SQL TABLE

## Result

* easily zoom in on "active" files

## Output

* plot shows rect per source file
* color = # of changes since last release
* one plot per release

## Ideas

- "waffle" plot shows colors in a grid... of squares
    - => TREEMAP
- overlay with dots representing functions / code?
