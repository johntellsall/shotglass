## Intro/Conc

I've always been fascinated by complex systems. So many parts interacting with each other. Clockworks.
Computer source code is similar: each function interacts with the others in often complex ways.

By plotting surface-level information about source code changes over time, I hope to get higher-level
understanding. What functions are more central to this system? What areas are setup once then never
touched again? Does code accumulate in one pile then the segments are split apart?
Can small or large code refactorings be made visible?
Can business-level events (XX push for release before big show, vendor) be seen?
Emergency security fixes (CVEs) -- what does this look like in the code graph?

## INBOX

* XX validate no files deleted

* perfect subject

* results

## OUTBOX

- plot single file's per-line file timestamps
    - code appeared all at once then minor changes after?
    - code gets shuffled over its history?
    - compare "dates at end" vs changes over time?
        - same lines get changed multiple times?
