# GOALS 202506

* directories-files
* capture per major release
* plot square per file
* render based on % changed over time
* grid: column per release, row with a square per file
* start with dirs-files at latest release
    * leave holes as files/dirs vanish in older releases

## test project: DNSMASQ

- 90 releases
- latest only 50 files, 50k LOC
