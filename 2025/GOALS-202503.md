# GOALS

* visualize
* FAST feedback loop
* FUN

## RISKS

* partial aports is 570 MB!
* SQL worth it if we always have to do a bunch of code anyway?
    * numpy??
    * one-shot programs: parse, filter, XX, visualize? Meh.
    * store state in shelve? Meh.

## TASKS

* XX show image in Vscode!
* X Vscode fix ^K
* Vscode fix ^E
- Vscode lint SQL
* rebuild Makefile -> super clear
* ripgrep always clickable (vimgrep)

## ALSO

* tests?
* shorten ETL with CSV -> Sqlite? Meh
    * risk of getting dirty w/o payoff
* click
    * import one release vs all
* JTA Fast Everything Vscode plugin

## IDEAS

* *love* tiny code in a Makefile with onchangem loop!
    * very effective and flexible
    * SQL as viz of partial products?
* documentation in functions makes a *huge* difference
